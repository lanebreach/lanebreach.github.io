    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>A bike lane breach report can be filed for any obstruction blocking a bike lane (cars, delivery trucks, buses, and many more).</p>
    <p>If you see a bike lane obstruction, there are two ways to submit a report:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If you have 30 seconds: complete a submission in real time by simply opening the app, taking a photo, entering a few fields about the obstruction, and submit! This option is preferred because the date/time of the blockage is important.</li>
    <li>If you don't have 30 seconds: open the camera app and take a few photos of the obstruction. At a later time (as soon as possible), open the app, select the best in-focus photo of the obstruction from the photo gallery, enter a few fields about the obstruction, and submit!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>More info</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Please put your own safety first.</b> We NEVER recommend taking a photo or completing a submission while actually riding in the bike lane</li>
    <li><b>Look around you (bicyclists may be behind you) and pull over to the side of the road</b>, away from auto and bike lane traffic, before taking a photo or starting a submission</li>
    <li><b>Be respectful.</b> Don't report users who have no other option but to temporarily block bike lanes (ex: parents dropping off/picking up young children or drivers dropping off/picking up people who are disabled)</li>
    <li><b>Interacting with other transit users:</b> We hope that capturing photos and submitting reports sparks a discussion of curiosity from transit users around you. Occasionally, this may not be the case and we suggest avoiding confrontations with other transit users. The best way to diffuse a situation is to explain you are helping the city of San Francisco to collect data about auto, bus, and bike usage so the city can better design parking, delivery, bus, and TNC loading/unloading spaces. We strongly support bicyclist rights, but starting confrontations on the road rarely helps our cause.</li>
